                    This website was created as a final project for my Web Systems and Technology course. I am both a badminton athlete and a programmer, and I wanted to combine these two passions into a single project.  I thought it would be fun to build something for a community I'm actually a part of. As an avid badminton player, I recognized the challenges of finding playmates and organizing games. This inspired me to develop The Rally Club, a platform designed to connect players and facilitate game scheduling within the badminton community.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Rally Club was started to solve one simple problem: finding people to play badminton with. Our mission is to connect players, make scheduling games easier, and build a strong local community for everyone who loves the sport, from beginners to advanced players.
            </p>

            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a prototype built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. There is no server or main database. All "created" games and posts are stored in simple arrays and will reset when the page is reloaded. It's designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-understand demonstration of the core features.
            </p>

            <h2>Core Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a Queue:</strong> Easily set up a new game by providing a location, date, time, price, and skill level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Join a Game:</strong> Browse all available games created by other players and join their queue with a single click.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Connect:</strong> A simple, text-only feed to share your thoughts, look for partners, or post about your latest match.
                </li>
            </ul>
